#Migrations directory for Nails apps.

Place your migrations files in here. Migrations should be named in a numerically significant fashion, i.e 1_init.php, 2_create_blog.php. The actual filename doesn't matter so long as it begins with an integer.

Migrations should be run on deployment. More information can be found in the docs.
