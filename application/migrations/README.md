Migrations directory for Nails. enabled apps.
=============================================

Place your migrations files in here. Migrations should be named in a numerically
significant fashion, i.e 1_init.php, 2_create_blog.php. the actual filename doesn't
matter so long as it begins with an integer.

Migrations should be run on deployment. More information can be found in the docs.
