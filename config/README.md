Configs for Nails. enabled apps.
================================

Apps need to be configured to use Nails. Not much configuration, granted,
but a little help is needed to point them in the right direction.

If this folder is empty, you'll need to run the Nails. installer; your app
will do this automatically if it can't find the right configuration files.

For maximum easiness, make sure this folder is writeable.
